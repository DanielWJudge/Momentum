# Basic Usage

Momentum is designed to help you focus on one task at a time. Here’s how to use the core features:

## Adding a Task
To start working, add a new task:

```bash
momentum add "Write project documentation"
```

This sets the new task as your active task.

## Viewing Your Active Task
Check your current task at any time:

```bash
momentum status
```

## Completing a Task
When you finish your task, mark it as done:

```bash
momentum done
```

## Starting a New Day
To archive completed tasks and start fresh:

```bash
momentum newday
```

## Cancelling a Task
If you need to cancel your current task:

```bash
momentum cancel
```

Momentum will always show you what’s active and keep your workflow simple and focused.
