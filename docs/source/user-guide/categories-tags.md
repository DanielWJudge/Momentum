# Categories & Tags

Momentum lets you organize tasks using categories (with `@`) and tags (with `#`).

## Adding Categories and Tags
Add a task with categories and tags:

```bash
momentum add "Write docs @work #documentation"
```

- `@work` is a category
- `#documentation` is a tag

You can add multiple categories and tags to a single task:

```bash
momentum add "Fix bug @work @urgent #bugfix #release"
```

## Why Use Categories and Tags?
- **Categories** help group tasks by context (e.g., `@work`, `@home`).
- **Tags** help filter and search for tasks by topic or priority (e.g., `#urgent`, `#feature`).

Use them together for powerful organization and filtering!
